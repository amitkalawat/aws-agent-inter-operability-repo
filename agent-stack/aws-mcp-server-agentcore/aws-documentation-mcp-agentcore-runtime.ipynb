    "## AWS Documentation MCP Server Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The AWS Documentation MCP server provides comprehensive access to AWS documentation through 3-4 specialized tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Global AWS Documentation Tools (AWS_DOCUMENTATION_PARTITION=aws)\n",
    "- **`read_documentation`**: Fetch and convert AWS documentation pages to markdown format\n",
    "- **`search_documentation`**: Search AWS documentation using the official search API\n",
    "- **`recommend`**: Get content recommendations for AWS documentation pages\n",
    "\n",
    "### China AWS Documentation Tools (AWS_DOCUMENTATION_PARTITION=aws-cn)\n",
    "- **`read_documentation`**: Fetch and convert AWS China documentation pages to markdown format\n",
    "- **`get_available_services`**: Get a list of available AWS services in China regions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "- **Public Documentation Access**: No AWS credentials required for documentation access\n",
    "- **Markdown Conversion**: Converts HTML documentation to clean markdown format\n",
    "- **Pagination Support**: Handle long documents with start_index parameter\n",
    "- **Search Integration**: Access to official AWS documentation search API\n",
    "- **Recommendation Engine**: Discover related content and recent updates\n",
    "- **Multi-Region Support**: Support for both global AWS and AWS China documentation\n",
    "- **Source Citation**: Always provides documentation URLs for reference\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage Examples\n",
    "- \"Look up documentation on S3 bucket naming rules. Cite your sources\"\n",
    "- \"Search for Lambda function invocation documentation\"\n",
    "- \"Recommend content for DynamoDB best practices\"\n",
    "- \"Find recent updates for Amazon Bedrock service\"\n",
    "\n",
    "All tools work with public AWS documentation and require no special AWS permissions beyond basic AgentCore runtime access."
